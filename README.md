##Getting and Cleaning Data Week 3 Course Project

From the Instructor Notes:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The requirements, as I interpret them, are:
1)
Merge the various data sets, key files together, selecting the required mean and standard deviation variables.
Write the resulting 'tidy' dataset to a text file
2)
Aggregate the tidy dataset on Activity, SubjectID, and Variable, providing the mean of the values for the grouping.
Write the resulting aggregated dataset to a text file
3)
Save the R code to a file
4)
Create a github repository for this project
Add the two data files and code file to source control
Commit and push the files to the github repository
5)
Upload the two data files via the Course Project UI
Provide the github repository URL

The contents of this repository are:
run_analysis.R		R code to clean and tidy the source data
UCI_HAR_data.txt	Text file containing the 'tidy' data set
UCI_HAR_mean.txt	Text file containing the aggregated data set
Readme.md		This file
CodeBook.txt		Documentation describing how the data was cleaned and the decisions made during the process.

========================================================
Execution Instructions for run_analysis.R file

Open the file in the text editor of your choice.
Open RStudio or RConsole.
Confirm the required packages and libraries are loaded, indicated at the top of the script.
Confirm the required data has been downloaded into the desired working directory. see the Codebook.md for download source.
In the R editor, set your working directory.
Copy and paste each uncommented line in the R script file into the R editor and execute one at a time
